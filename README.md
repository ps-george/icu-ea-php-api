# ICU eActivities API

A PHP API for Imperial College Union's [eActivities](https://eactivities.union.ic.ac.uk).

## Install
Place the [api](https://github.com/ps-george/icu-ea-php-api/blob/master/example/api) and [js](https://github.com/ps-george/icu-ea-php-api/blob/master/example/js) files in your project.

You will also need [datatables](https://github.com/ps-george/icu-ea-php-api/blob/master/example/static).

## Example
To run the example, download the [example](https://github.com/ps-george/icu-ea-php-api/tree/master/example) folder and host a php-enabled webserver inside the directory:

Replace `code`, `key`, and `year` in [config.php](https://github.com/ps-george/icu-ea-php-api/tree/master/example/api/config.php) with your own values.

If you gave the correct values, you should see a table of the society's members.
